What is Generative AI:

Generative artificial intelligence or generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence system capable of generating text, images, or other media in response to prompts. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) describes algorithms (such as ChatGPT) that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos. Recent breakthroughs in the field have the potential to drastically change the way we approach content creation. Generative AI models use neural networks to identify the patterns and structures within existing data to generate new and original content.
One of the breakthroughs with generative AI models is the ability to leverage different learning approaches, including unsupervised or semi-supervised learning for training. This has given organizations the ability to more easily and quickly leverage a large amount of unlabeled data to create foundation models. As the name suggests, foundation models can be used as a base for AI systems that can perform multiple tasks. 
Examples of foundation models include GPT-3 and Stable Diffusion, which allow users to leverage the power of language. For example, popular applications like ChatGPT, which draws from GPT-3, allow users to generate an essay based on a short text request. On the other hand, Stable Diffusion allows users to generate photorealistic images given a text input.

The three key requirements of a successful generative AI model are:  

Quality: Especially for applications that interact directly with users, having high-quality generation outputs is key. For example, in speech generation, poor speech quality is difficult to understand. Similarly, in image generation, the desired outputs should be visually indistinguishable from natural images.
Diversity: A good generative model captures the minority modes in its data distribution without sacrificing generation quality. This helps reduce undesired biases in the learned models.
Speed: Many interactive applications require fast generation, such as real-time image editing to allow use in content creation workflows.

GPT:
Generative pre-trained transformers are a type of large language model and a prominent framework for generative artificial intelligence. The first GPT was introduced in 2018 by OpenAI.
Recent Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10435
GPT models are artificial neural networks that are based on the transformer architecture, pre-trained on large data sets of unlabelled text, and able to generate novel human-like content.[2][3] As of 2023, most LLMs have these characteristics[7] and are sometimes referred to broadly as GPTs.[8]



Transformer:  
A Transformer is a deep learning architecture that relies on the attention mechanism.[1] It is notable for requiring less training time compared to previous recurrent neural architectures, such as long short-term memory (LSTM),[2] and has been prevalently adopted for training large language models on large (language) datasets, such as the Wikipedia Corpus and Common Crawl, by virtue of the parallelized processing of input sequence.[3] More specifically, the model takes in tokenized (byte pair encoding) input tokens, and at each layer, contextualises each token with other (unmasked) input tokens in parallel via attention mechanism. Though the Transformer model came out in 2017, the core attention mechanism was proposed earlier in 2014 by Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio for machine translation.[4][5] This architecture is now used not only in natural language processing, computer vision,[6] but also in audio,[7] and multi-modal processing. It has also led to the development of pre-trained systems, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs)[8] and BERT[9] (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).

Applications of GPT:
GPT-3 is already being used in a variety of real-world applications, with many businesses and organisations experiencing significant benefits from its integration. Some of the most notable real-world applications of GPT-3 include:

Chatbots and customer service: 
Companies like H&M and Uber are using GPT-3-powered chatbots to provide quick and efficient customer service. The chatbots are able to understand and respond to customer inquiries in a human-like manner, improving customer satisfaction and reducing the workload for human customer service representatives.

Content creation and marketing: 
Companies like OpenAI and Scribendi are using GPT-3 to generate high-quality content for websites, social media, and other marketing channels. This saves time and resources for businesses and improves the overall quality of their content.

Virtual assistants and personal productivity: 
Virtual assistant applications like Google Assistant and Apple’s Siri are using GPT-3 to improve their language capabilities and provide more accurate responses to users. This improves the overall user experience and makes it easier for people to manage their tasks and schedules.
Language translation and interpretation: 
Companies like iFlytek and Microsoft are using GPT-3 for language translation and interpretation, making it easier for people to communicate with each other in different languages.
